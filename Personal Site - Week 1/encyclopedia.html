    <h1>Spy x Family</h1>
    <hr class="dotted" />
    <p>
      Spy × Family (stylized as SPY×FAMILY; pronounced "Spy Family") is a
      Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuya Endo. The story
      follows a spy who has to "build a family" to execute a mission, not
      realizing that the girl he adopts as his daughter is a telepath, and the
      woman he agrees to be in a marriage with is a skilled assassin. The series
      has been serialized biweekly on Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+ application and
      website since March 2019, with the chapters collected in nine tankōbon
      volumes as of April 2022. It was licensed in North America by Viz Media.

      with spying on Donovan Desmond, leader of the National Unity Party within
      Ostania. However, due to Desmond being notoriously reclusive, the only way
      Twilight can get close to him is to enroll a child in the same private
      school as Desmond's sons and pose as a fellow parent.
