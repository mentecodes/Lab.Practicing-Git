    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups dried macaroni</li>
      <li>1 whole egg</li>
      <li>1/4 cup salted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cup whole milk</li>
      <li>2 tsp (heaping) dry mustard, more if desired</li>
      <li>1 lb cheese (such as cheddar, jack, and or fontina), grated</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt, more to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp seasoned salt, more to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the macaroni until very firm. The macaroni should be too firm to
        eat right out of the pot. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg.</li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, melt the butter and sprinkle in the flour. Whisk
        together over medium-low heat. Cook the mixture for 5 minutes, whisking
        constantly. Don’t let it burn. Pour in the milk, add the mustard, and
        whisk until smooth. Cook for 5 minutes until very thick. Reduce the heat
        to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take 1/4 cup of the sauce and slowly pour it into the beaten egg,
        whisking constantly to avoid cooking the egg. Whisk together till
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the egg mixture into the sauce, whisking constantly. Stir until
        smooth. Add in the cheese and stir to melt. Add the salt, seasoned salt
        and pepper. Taste the sauce and add more salt and seasoned salt as
        needed! DO NOT UNDERSALT. Pour in the drained, cooked macaroni and stir
        to combine. Serve immediately (very creamy) or pour into a buttered
        baking dish, top with extra cheese, and bake at 350˚ for 20 to 25
        minutes, or until bubbly and golden on top.
      </li>
    </ol>
